Invest in technology and bring value back to your business
<p>TonkaBI is supporting insurance companies today in the race towards a smarter future for general insurance and claims processing. We all know that artificial intelligence is here and it is here to stay. But do we have a clear idea as to how fast it’s coming and its real true capabilities? TonkaBI has worked in AI and IoT and Machine Learning, mainly focused around <b><a href="http://www.tonkabi.com/analytics-solution">insurance analytics</a></b> and is able to share its experiences and techniques with interested insurance companies, companies that want to take advantage of this new technology.</p>

<p>Machine learning automation delivers a high level of efficiency that isn’t humanly possible and will increase query response time by a 100%. The most mundane tasks within processing and within business systems can be carried out by embedded AI (Artificial Intelligence). This has been proven to be highly effective and more efficient than any human. Machines work without breaks - 7 days a week, 24 hours a day and no holidays. That’s being productive!</p>

<p>What your customers experience from their perspective can be illustrated through distress signals. These distress signals can be taught to machines through <b><a href="http://www.tonkabi.com/machine-learning">machine learning</a></b> algorithms. The machine will then identify these small issues in real time, allowing companies to take immediate action for the resolution. Watch, report, respond and manage all in real time giving you the ability to resolve small customer service issues before they build up into a big issue.</p>

<p>How is this done?</p>

<p>TonkaBI will complete a structured audit and scope of your requirements and how your company operates and processes data to gain insight into your business. This will be crucial for when the project commences. More importantly this will help TonkaBI understand you and your company and during this time what you desire from the technology and find important, will be highlighted and expectations can be laid out. Communication is the key to success through-out the whole project.</p>

<p>Once the project scope is set and the audit is complete and all parties have agreed upon the delivery TonkaBI will start a PoC (proof of concept). The aim of the PoC is to again understand and gain knowledge, furthermore, to start implementation of the ML algorithm into a small sector of your business, to provide proof that machine is indeed working, adding value to your business and also expectations are getting fulfilled.</p>

<p>TonkaBI’s team will be continuously working with you every step of the way to improve and optimize the code. This is all a part of our service and determination to bring you the best results and value into your business.</p>

<p>Once the machine has spent time in your system and the algorithms have adapted and gained insight this is where your will start to see a ROT (return of investment). As mentioned the biggest plus factor for machine automation is the ability of continuation at rapid rates, no breaks, no holidays just 24/7 work!</p>

<p>Every TonkaBI MI and AI solution is unique and one of a kind, we create solutions for software.</p>
